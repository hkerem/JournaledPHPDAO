Journaled PHP DAO
=================================================

Restrictions:
Tables only can have one primary key whose name should be 'id' and type should be 'unsigned integer'.
Also all tables should have following fields and indexes:
	  `rid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
	  `is_deleted` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
	  `create_epoch` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
	  `delete_epoch` int(10) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY (`rid`),
	  KEY `id` (`id`)

That's all..

How to rest:
Rest CRUD controllers for DAO objects could be found in generated/class/rest directory. Also these could be registered with RestDAOFacade::register($restserver) .
